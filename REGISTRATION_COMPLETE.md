## Usage

### Before (Manual Registration Required) ❌

```python
from elysia import Tree
from elysia.tools.retrieval.hashtag_aggregate import HashtagAggregate

tree = Tree()
tree.add_tool(tool=HashtagAggregate, branch_id="search")  # Manual step!

response, objects = tree(
    "Who tweets most with #السلطان_هيثم_يزور_بيلاروس?",
    collection_names=["ArabicTweets"]
)
```

### After (Automatic Registration) ✅

```python
from elysia import Tree

tree = Tree()  # HashtagAggregate is already available!

response, objects = tree(
    "Who tweets most with #السلطان_هيثم_يزور_بيلاروس?",
    collection_names=["ArabicTweets"]
)
```

---

## Tool Details

### Name
`hashtag_aggregate`

### Branch Location
- **multi_branch**: `search` branch (alongside Query and Aggregate)
- **one_branch**: `base` branch

### Description
```
Aggregate tweet counts by author filtered by a specific hashtag.
Use this tool when you need to count tweets by author that contain a specific hashtag.
This tool performs hashtag-filtered aggregation which is not available in the
standard 'aggregate' tool.
```

### Inputs
| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `hashtag` | str | Yes | - | Hashtag to filter by (with or without #) |
| `collection_name` | str | Yes | - | Collection containing tweets |
| `author_property` | str | No | `"author"` | Property with author info |
| `text_property` | str | No | `"text"` | Property with tweet text |
| `limit` | int | No | `1000` | Max tweets to retrieve |

---

## Example Queries

### Basic Query
```python
from elysia import Tree

tree = Tree()
response, objects = tree(
    "Who tweets most frequently with #example?",
    collection_names=["Tweets"]
)
```

### Arabic Query
```python
response, objects = tree(
    "من هو الأكثر تغريداً بوسم #السلطان_هيثم_يزور_بيلاروس؟",
    collection_names=["ArabicTweets"]
)
```

### Natural Language Variations
The LLM will recognize these patterns and use hashtag_aggregate:
- "Who tweets most with hashtag X?"
- "Top authors for #hashtag"
- "Count tweets by author with #hashtag"
- "Most frequent tweeter with #hashtag"

---

## Integration Points

### Tree Initializations

#### Default / Multi-Branch ✅
```python
tree = Tree()  # or Tree(branch_initialisation="default")
# hashtag_aggregate is in "search" branch
```

#### Multi-Branch Explicit ✅
```python
tree = Tree(branch_initialisation="multi_branch")
# hashtag_aggregate is in "search" branch
```

#### One-Branch ✅
```python
tree = Tree(branch_initialisation="one_branch")
# hashtag_aggregate is in "base" branch
```

#### Empty ⚠️
```python
tree = Tree(branch_initialisation="empty")
# No tools registered (by design)
# Must manually add tools if needed
```

## Comparison with Standard Tools

| Feature | Standard Aggregate | HashtagAggregate |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| Count by author | ✅ | ✅ |
| Filter by hashtag | ❌ | ✅ |
| Native Weaviate aggregation | ✅ | ❌ (query + post-process) |
| Performance (large datasets) | Faster | Good (with limits) |
| Use case | General aggregation | Hashtag-specific analysis |

---

## Files Modified

| File | Change | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `elysia/tree/tree.py` | Added import & registration | Make tool available by default |
| `elysia/tools/retrieval/__init__.py` | Added export | Enable clean imports |
| `scripts/verify_tool_registration.py` | New file | Validate registration |

---

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Code

**If you previously manually registered:**
```python
# OLD CODE (still works, but unnecessary)
tree = Tree()
tree.add_tool(tool=HashtagAggregate, branch_id="search")

# NEW CODE (simplified)
tree = Tree()
# Tool is already available!
```

**No breaking changes** - existing code will continue to work. The manual registration step is now redundant but harmless.

---

## Testing

### Automated Verification
```bash
# Activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run verification script
python scripts/verify_tool_registration.py
```

### Manual Testing
```python
from elysia import Tree

# Create tree
tree = Tree()

# Verify tool is available
assert "hashtag_aggregate" in tree.tools
print("✓ Tool registered successfully")

# Test query (requires Weaviate connection)
response, objects = tree(
    "Test hashtag query",
    collection_names=["YourCollection"]
)
```

## Benefits

### For Users
✅ **Simplified Usage** - No manual registration required
✅ **Consistent Experience** - Works like other default tools
✅ **Discovery** - LLM automatically finds and uses the tool
✅ **Reduced Boilerplate** - Less code to write

### For Developers
✅ **Maintainability** - Tool is part of standard distribution
✅ **Discoverability** - Users know it's available
✅ **Testing** - Can test with default Tree configuration
✅ **Documentation** - Standard tool documentation applies

## Architecture

### Tool Location in Tree

```
Tree (multi_branch initialization)
├─ base (root)
│  ├─ cited_summarize
│  ├─ text_response
│  ├─ visualise
│  └─ search
│     ├─ query
│     ├─ aggregate
│     └─ hashtag_aggregate ⭐
│        └─ query_postprocessing
```

### Decision Flow

```
User: "Who tweets most with #hashtag?"
  ↓
Tree: Analyze query
  ├─ Contains "hashtag" keyword ✓
  ├─ Asks about counting/aggregation ✓
  └─ Filtered by specific hashtag ✓
  ↓
Tree: Select hashtag_aggregate tool
  ↓
Tool: Execute hashtag filtering & aggregation
  ↓
Result: Author counts for specific hashtag
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Tool Not Found
**Problem**: `"hashtag_aggregate is not available"`

**Solution**: Verify you're using updated code:
```python
from elysia import Tree
tree = Tree()
print("hashtag_aggregate" in tree.tools)  # Should be True
```

If False, ensure you're using the updated `tree.py` file.

### Wrong Tool Selected
**Problem**: LLM uses `aggregate` instead of `hashtag_aggregate`

**Solution**: Be explicit in query wording:
```python
# Better: Mention "hashtag" explicitly
"Who tweets most with hashtag #example?"

# Less effective: Generic aggregation
"Who tweets the most?"
```

### Import Error
**Problem**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'HashtagAggregate'`

**Solution**: Verify file exists:
```bash
ls -la elysia/tools/retrieval/hashtag_aggregate.py
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- [ ] Multiple hashtag support (AND/OR logic)
- [ ] Time-based filtering (date ranges)
- [ ] Regex patterns for hashtag matching
- [ ] Streaming results for large datasets
- [ ] Caching for frequently queried hashtags

---

## Changelog

### v1.0.0 - Default Registration
- ✅ Added HashtagAggregate to default tool set
- ✅ Registered in both multi_branch and one_branch initializations
- ✅ Added to retrieval tools exports
- ✅ Created verification script
- ✅ Updated documentation

---

## Summary

**Status**: 🟢 **COMPLETE**

The HashtagAggregate tool is now a first-class citizen in Elysia:
- ✅ Automatically registered by default
- ✅ Available in all standard Tree configurations
- ✅ Verified and tested
- ✅ Documented and ready for use

**Impact**: Users can now perform hashtag-specific author aggregation without any setup!

---

**Next Steps**: Start using it!

```python
from elysia import Tree

tree = Tree()
response, objects = tree(
    "Who tweets most frequently with #السلطان_هيثم_يزور_بيلاروس?",
    collection_names=["ArabicTweets"]
)

print(response)
# "The author who tweets most frequently with #السلطان_هيثم_يزور_بيلاروس
#  is **مها البلوشيه** with 32 tweets..."
```

🎉 **Success!**
