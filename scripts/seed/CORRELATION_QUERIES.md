# Cross-Collection Correlation Query Examples

This document provides example queries to test the correlation capabilities of Elysia using the `SocialMediaPosts` and `AudioTranscriptions` collections.

## üìä Collection Overview

### SocialMediaPosts
- **Records**: ~13 multilingual tweets
- **Languages**: Arabic (ar), English (en), Italian (it)
- **Key Fields**: post_id, content, language, timestamp, author_id, topic, sentiment, hashtags, event_id, location

### AudioTranscriptions
- **Records**: ~10 multilingual transcripts
- **Languages**: Arabic (ar), English (en), Italian (it)
- **Key Fields**: transcription_id, transcript, language, duration_seconds, timestamp, speaker_id, topic, audio_quality, keywords, event_id, session_type

## üîó Correlation Keys

Both collections share these fields for correlation:
1. **event_id** - Same event/conference
2. **author_id / speaker_id** - Same person
3. **topic** - Related topics
4. **timestamp** - Temporal correlation
5. **language** - Language-based analysis

## üìù Example Query Scenarios

### 1. Event-Based Correlation

**Query**: "Show me all content from the tech conference 2025 (both posts and transcripts)"

**Expected Result**:
- All 13 posts with `event_id: "tech_conf_2025"`
- All 10 transcripts with `event_id: "tech_conf_2025"`
- Displays combined results from both collections

---

### 2. Person-Based Correlation

**Query**: "Find all contributions from Ahmed (both social posts and speeches)"

**Expected Result**:
- Posts where `author_id: "user_ahmed"` (3 posts)
- Transcripts where `speaker_id: "user_ahmed"` (3 keynote transcripts)
- Shows Ahmed's activity across platforms

**Variant**: "What did Sarah say in her talks vs what she posted on social media?"

---

### 3. Topic Correlation

**Query**: "Compare discussions about machine learning in medicine across social media and conference sessions"

**Expected Result**:
- Posts with `topic: "ML in Medicine"` (3 posts)
- Transcripts with `topic: "ML in Medicine"` (3 panel transcripts)
- Reveals how the topic is discussed in different contexts

---

### 4. Multilingual Analysis

**Query**: "Show me all Italian content from the conference (posts and speeches)"

**Expected Result**:
- Posts where `language: "it"` (4 Italian posts)
- Transcripts where `language: "it"` (4 Italian transcripts)
- Language-specific perspective

**Variant**: "Compare sentiment about the workshop in Arabic vs English vs Italian"

---

### 5. Temporal Correlation

**Query**: "What were people posting during the ML basics workshop?"

**Expected Result**:
- Workshop started at 14:00 (5 hours after base_time)
- Posts timestamped around 14:00-15:00 (negative sentiment)
- Transcripts from the workshop session
- Shows real-time social reaction to live events

**Variant**: "Show the timeline of all activities on January 15, 2025"

---

### 6. Sentiment vs Content Analysis

**Query**: "Compare the sentiment in social posts about the keynote with the actual keynote content"

**Expected Result**:
- Keynote transcripts (topic: "AI in Healthcare", positive technical content)
- Social posts about keynote (all positive sentiment)
- Reveals alignment between content and reception

**Variant**: "Which sessions generated negative reactions on social media?"

---

### 7. Speaker-Audience Interaction

**Query**: "Find sessions where Marco asked questions and compare with his social posts"

**Expected Result**:
- Marco's posts (tw_008, tw_010, others)
- Workshop transcript where Marco is mentioned (aud_010 Q&A)
- Shows participant engagement across channels

---

### 8. Keyword Correlation

**Query**: "Find all content mentioning 'diagnostics' or 'medical' across both collections"

**Expected Result**:
- Transcripts with keywords: ["Medical", "Diagnostics"] (aud_002, aud_003, etc.)
- Posts with hashtags: ["#Healthcare"] or content mentioning medical topics
- Cross-collection semantic search

---

### 9. Session Type Analysis

**Query**: "Compare social media sentiment for keynotes vs workshops vs panels"

**Expected Result**:
- Keynote posts: mostly positive
- Workshop posts: mixed/negative (too basic)
- Panel posts: very positive
- Aggregated by session_type from transcripts

---

### 10. Cross-Language Person Tracking

**Query**: "Track Ahmed's contributions in all languages"

**Expected Result**:
- Arabic post (tw_001) + Arabic keynote (aud_001, aud_002)
- English keynote (aud_005) + English Q&A (aud_009)
- Italian keynote (aud_008)
- Shows multilingual participation

## üéØ Advanced Query Patterns

### Pattern 1: Aggregation Across Collections
```
"What is the overall sentiment distribution for the conference?"
‚Üí Aggregate sentiment from SocialMediaPosts
‚Üí Correlate with session types from AudioTranscriptions
```

### Pattern 2: Temporal Clustering
```
"Group all conference activities by hour and show the mix of social posts and sessions"
‚Üí Filter both collections by timestamp
‚Üí Group by hour bucket
‚Üí Display mixed results
```

### Pattern 3: Topic Evolution
```
"How did the discussion about AI evolve throughout the day?"
‚Üí Order both collections by timestamp
‚Üí Filter by topic containing "AI"
‚Üí Show chronological progression
```

### Pattern 4: Language Distribution
```
"Show the language breakdown for each topic discussed"
‚Üí Group by topic
‚Üí Count by language in both collections
‚Üí Compare coverage across languages
```

### Pattern 5: Quality vs Sentiment
```
"Do high-quality audio sessions get more positive social reactions?"
‚Üí Filter transcripts by audio_quality: "high"
‚Üí Join with posts by topic + timestamp proximity
‚Üí Analyze sentiment correlation
```

## üîç Testing Methodology

1. **Start Simple**: Test single-collection queries first
2. **Add Correlation**: Introduce cross-collection filters
3. **Test Multilingua**: Query across languages
4. **Complex Aggregations**: Test grouping and statistics
5. **Temporal Analysis**: Test time-based correlations

---

## üìà Expected Capabilities

After analyzing both collections, Elysia should be able to:

‚úÖ Query multiple collections simultaneously
‚úÖ Correlate data via common fields (event_id, author_id/speaker_id)
‚úÖ Handle multilingual content (ar, en, it)
‚úÖ Perform semantic search across languages
‚úÖ Aggregate and group by correlation keys
‚úÖ Filter with complex temporal logic
‚úÖ Track entities (people, topics) across collections

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Analyze both collections in Elysia frontend
2. Try natural language versions of these queries
3. Verify cross-collection results
4. Test semantic search across languages
5. Evaluate correlation accuracy

---

## üí° Tips for Effective Testing

- **Be Specific**: Mention both collection names when needed
- **Use Natural Language**: Elysia understands conversational queries
- **Test Edge Cases**: Try queries that span all languages
- **Verify Metadata**: Check that correlation fields are correctly mapped
- **Analyze Results**: Review how Elysia combines results from multiple sources
