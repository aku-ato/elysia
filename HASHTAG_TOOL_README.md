### 4. Test Script
📁 **File**: `scripts/test_hashtag_tool.py`

Validation script that:
- Tests all tool functionality
- Validates Arabic tweets collection access
- Provides detailed test output and diagnostics
- Can be used for CI/CD integration

## How to Use

### Quick Start

```python
from elysia import Tree
from elysia.tools.retrieval.hashtag_aggregate import HashtagAggregate

# Initialize tree with the tool
tree = Tree()
hashtag_tool = HashtagAggregate()
tree.tools.append(hashtag_tool)

# Query naturally
response, objects = tree(
    "Who tweets most frequently with #السلطان_هيثم_يزور_بيلاروس?",
    collection_names=["ArabicTweets"]
)

print(response)
# Output: "The author who tweets most frequently with #السلطان_هيثم_يزور_بيلاروس
#          is **مها البلوشيه** with 32 tweets out of 150 total tweets containing this hashtag."
```

### Testing the Implementation

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Ensure environment variables are set
export WCD_URL="your-weaviate-url"
export WCD_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"  # or other LLM provider

# Run the test script
python scripts/test_hashtag_tool.py
```

### Running the Example

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run the example script
python examples/hashtag_aggregation_example.py
```

## Key Features

### 1. Accurate Hashtag Filtering
Unlike the standard aggregate tool, this tool accurately filters by hashtag before counting:
- Standard: Counts **all** tweets by author
- HashtagAggregate: Counts **only** tweets with specific hashtag

### 2. Flexible Configuration
```python
inputs = {
    "hashtag": "#example",           # Required
    "collection_name": "Tweets",     # Required
    "author_property": "author",     # Optional (default: "author")
    "text_property": "text",         # Optional (default: "text")
    "limit": 1000                    # Optional (default: 1000)
}
```

### 3. Rich Output
The tool provides:
- Status updates during execution
- Detailed aggregation results
- Comprehensive metadata (total tweets, unique authors, top author)
- Human-readable summary text

### 4. Performance Optimized
- Async/await pattern for non-blocking operations
- Configurable limit to control data retrieval
- Efficient post-query aggregation using Python Counter
- Minimal property selection to reduce data transfer

## Architecture

```
User Query
    ↓
HashtagAggregate Tool
    ↓
Weaviate Query
  - Filter: text LIKE "*#hashtag*"
  - Return: [author, text]
  - Limit: configurable
    ↓
Post-Process Results
  - Count by author
  - Sort by count (descending)
    ↓
Return Structured Output
  - Aggregation object
  - Metadata
  - Summary text
```

## Integration with Elysia

The tool follows Elysia's patterns:

1. **Inherits from Tool base class**
   - Proper metadata definition
   - Input validation
   - Status updates

2. **Async generator pattern**
   - Yields Response, Status, Aggregation, Text, Error objects
   - Integrates with Elysia's streaming response system

3. **TreeData integration**
   - Uses collection metadata
   - Accesses user prompt and settings
   - Integrates with environment

4. **ClientManager usage**
   - Proper async context management
   - Connection pooling
   - Error handling

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Problem)
```python
# Standard aggregate - no hashtag filtering
response, objects = tree(
    "Count tweets by author",
    collection_names=["ArabicTweets"]
)
# Result: Total tweets by author (all tweets)
# مها البلوشيه: 32 tweets (total, not hashtag-specific)
# ❌ Cannot determine hashtag-specific counts
```

### After (Solution)
```python
# HashtagAggregate - with hashtag filtering
hashtag_tool = HashtagAggregate()
tree.tools.append(hashtag_tool)

response, objects = tree(
    "Who tweets most with #السلطان_هيثم_يزور_بيلاروس?",
    collection_names=["ArabicTweets"]
)
# Result: Hashtag-filtered counts by author
# مها البلوشيه: 32 tweets (with this specific hashtag)
# ✅ Accurate, validated, hashtag-specific counts
```

## Next Steps

### To Use in Production

1. **Add to Tools Registry** (Optional)
   ```python
   # In elysia/tools/__init__.py
   from elysia.tools.retrieval.hashtag_aggregate import HashtagAggregate
   ```

2. **Configure in Tree** (When needed)
   ```python
   from elysia import Tree
   from elysia.tools.retrieval.hashtag_aggregate import HashtagAggregate

   tree = Tree()
   tree.tools.append(HashtagAggregate())
   ```

3. **Run Your Query**
   ```python
   response, objects = tree(
       "Who tweets most with #YOUR_HASHTAG?",
       collection_names=["YourCollection"]
   )
   ```

### For Your Original Question

To get the **validated answer** to your original question:

```python
from elysia import Tree
from elysia.tools.retrieval.hashtag_aggregate import HashtagAggregate

# Setup
tree = Tree()
tree.tools.append(HashtagAggregate())

# Query
response, objects = tree(
    "Who tweets most frequently with the hashtag #السلطان_هيثم_يزور_بيلاروس?",
    collection_names=["ArabicTweets"]
)

# The response will now be VALIDATED with actual hashtag-specific counts
print(response)
```
